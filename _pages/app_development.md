Mobile phone technology is being extensively used in Africa and elsewhere to provide information, services, and education to people in rural communities. At its best, a mobile service has advantages over traditional approaches – it can provide cheap, up-to-date information, which is tailored to the needs of the individual receiving it, and relevant to their particular location. 

This aspect of _DOWN2EARTH_, led by the Digital User Engagement Team (DUET), will develop/enhance several desktop and mobile phone app services for use by agro-pastoralists to access tailored information generated from our hydrological model. These provide information from seasonal forecasts (for the upcoming rainy season) on soil moisture storage, groundwater storage, and crop yields for a set of different crop types for a given user’s location, as percentage differences (plus or minus) compared to a defined baseline condition. The apps will also report uncertainty estimates for these forecasts. The services will be designed in such a way that it provides this information that is tailored to the specific context of agro-pastoralists in HAD. They will also present information in a way which is sensitive to their culture and existing practices, so it can be easily interpreted and acted upon. The apps will ideally also provide a channel for the agro-pastoralists to input their own observations, and we will explore ways to motivate them to do this.
